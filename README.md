# simple text-based digital assistant

I attempted to provide information about the following in this implementation: - Time, Local weather, A basic search engine to learn about a phrase or a definition, Grab a nearby restaurant, Take a tram from the starting point to the final destination. This rule-based dialogue system was created using "keyword matching," depending on your preference. With our implementation, we made an effort to look for specific keywords in user input and use those phrases to determine the user's purpose. When this intent is chosen, appropriate function calls are made to provide a response. Based on the use case, a manual look-up dictionary of keywords and purpose was created. This implementation uses the  distinct intent keyword dictionary.
